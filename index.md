<h2>The Journey</h2>
Probably one of the best I got to learn a lot of interesting stuffs and a lot about the code of conduct to be maintained in Open Source. One of the most important thing I learned was Open Source is not just finding a bug providing a patch but also to see how     useful your patch will be to the project. Because its not just you its the whole community affected by it.   

<h2>Projects Involved</h2>
During the one month long program I worked on the following projects like:

* 2048
* Sympy
* URL-Shortener
* Youtube Data Collector
* Youtube Fast Playlist

<h2>Areas worked upon</h2>

* Pygame
* Django
* RequireJS
* Youtube API
* Chrome Extensions
* Maths and Computation
* Markdown
* Frontend

<h2>Summary</h2>

* I started the program by first contributing to the sympy community. Sent 3 patches although couldn't get any of theme merged though but I learnt about what Sympy was all about and about Travis CI as an excellent testing interface. I mostly worked upon the Domains and Polynomial Rings and the RS Series. Was quite active in the gitter chat too.
* Next was 2048 where I learnt a bit about Pygame and had a chance to show my frontend skills. Sent in a couple of patches there.
* Next came the URL Shortener where I worked the most. Again did the frontend part add used Clipboard.js. The project was in Django which I am familiar with so brushed up my skills. Sent 3 patches there.
* Then shifted on to the Youtube Data Collector and learnt a lot of interesting stuffs about Chrome Extensions. Sent in a patch and was very active in the chat room.
* The last was the Youtube Fast Playlist project. I added the **Multiple Playlist** functionality to it. Retrieving and storing data into the cache was the most important task I carried out. Also learnt a lot about the Youtube API and RequireJS. Sent in a patch and was an active member of the chat room

<h2>Other Contributions/ Learnings</h2>
As Open Source is all about learning and contributing I focused more on the learning part rather than just sending in the patches. I was an active member of the chat room discussions for the projects **B.E.N.J.I and Air Hockey**. I learnt a lot about AI and Speech Recognition. I used to read in the queries posted in the discussion forums and they helped me a lot in the entire program. Styling your code in a proper manner is very much important. I also got to learn a lot more about Git and how useful it can be when too many collaborators work together on a big project.

<h2>Closure</h2>
Overall it was an excellent journey and I learnt a lot from my mentors and also the other participants. Also,  Helping each other and giving in your inputs always helps. Some of the stuffs I got to know about, I never even saw them earlier. This would certainly help me in GSoC further. Thanks KOSS !!
